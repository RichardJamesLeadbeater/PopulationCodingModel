# define params for tiling of feature space

# define params for stimuli values

# define params for tuning of neural populations

# define params for response of neural populations

# each neural population as instance of class
    # boundaries
    # bandwidth
    # sampling frequency
    # max firing rate
    # preferences
    # genTunings()

# adjust boundaries of each population based on sampling frequencies

# piece together tuningArrays and prefVectors from each population into allPops

# generate response for allPops from stim_vals

# decode allPops responses (WTA, PV, ML)
